## My process

This was pretty basic card. I used Tailwind and built from a mobile first perspective. Nothing crazy but a fun little project none-the-less.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time doing a Frontend Mentor exercise completely using Tailwind. I experimented and found a good workflow in building mobile first with Tailwind and was able to frame this out fairly quickly. I used custom colors in Tailwind for the first time and also tried to use Tailwind base properties as much as possible so it's not as pixel perfect but maintains a very consistent look.

### Continued development

Next steps will be to build out a few basic websites completely in Tailwind. I'd also like to learn more about customizing components in Tailwind. React's component based framework will be particularly useful with Tailwind.
